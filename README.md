# Merkel Binary Tree - A project on (Cryptography and Hashing)



## About

*Implementing File encryption using* **Merkel Tree Algorithm**

>  A system to check the Integrity of the files in a folder in order to
> avoid tampering of the data in any instance. If there is a file transfer from source to destination then the user receiving this file can easily check for any modification in the source file thus guaranteeing safe transactions.


## Description
Merkle Trees are a fundamental component of blockchains that underpin their functionality they work on the concepts of **Pseudo Random functions** .They allow for efficient and secure verification of large data structures, and in the case of blockchains, potentially boundless data sets.

## Structure of a Merkel Tree

A **Tree** data structure where each ***non-leaf node is a hash of itâ€™s child node*** and
all the ***leaf nodes contain*** the **cryptographic** hashes of the data set.

**Merkel Root**: The Root of this tree holds a unique cryptographic hash as the fingerprint for the entire data in a binary Merkel tree

## Data Structures Used

 1. Binary tree as GGM tree with a structure 
    ```c
    struct Merkel_node{ 
    char *hashconcat; 
    struct Merkel_node *left;
    struct Merkel_node *right
    };
    ```

 2. Stack to Hold hashes of child nodes to concatenate these in the
    parent node.
 3. File reading techniques in C
 4. Cryptography Hashing function to generate Hash codes of a fixed
    length for any arbitrary length and to avoid any hashing collisions(using concepts of SHA-256 Algorithm).
 5. Pointers in C

## Inputs & Features

 - User has to input the set of files he wants to secure.
 - The data in each individual files are passed to a cryptographic hash
   function and unique hash codes are generated
 - Thus a Merkel root is generated at the end after hashing these files at each
   levels from leaf nodes to the root thus generating a single unique
   hash code for the set of files.
  - A Recursive Tree Generator function which can concatenate the hash results of individual nodes until we reach the root!,This function handles the case of converting odd      number of nodes if present in each level of the tree to an even length inorder to hash it

```c
struct Merkel_node *generateTree(struct Merkel_node **leafnodes, int n)
{
    if (n == 1)
        return leafnodes[0];

    int y = n / 2, isOdd = 0;
    if (y % 2 != 0 && y != 1)
    {
        y++;
        isOdd = 1;
    }  //A function to create the non-leaf nodes if the number of nodes are odd then create a new node to make it even then replicate the data of the previous node

    struct Merkel_node **temp = malloc(y * sizeof(struct Merkel_node *));
    
        int e = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (i % 2 != 0)
            {
                char temphash[400], hash[400];
                strcpy(temphash, leafnodes[i - 1]->hashconcat);
                strcat(temphash, leafnodes[i]->hashconcat);
                concatHash(temphash, 256, hash);
                temp[e] = createnode(hash);
                temp[e]->left = leafnodes[i - 1];
                temp[e]->right = leafnodes[i];
                e++;
            }//A structure holding structure of merkel leaf nodes to track the nodes
        }
        if (isOdd)
        {
            temp[e] = temp[e - 1];
            temp[e]->left = NULL;
            temp[e]->right = NULL;
        }
    
    generateTree(temp, y);
}

***Any Tamper in the data of any individual file in this set leads to the mismatch of the Merkel root hash code thus indicating that someone has modified the file***
